1. **Difference between `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join:**

   - Both `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` are types of outer joins in SQL.
   - In a `LEFT OUTER` join, all rows from the left table (the one specified before the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` clause) are included, along with matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
   - In a `RIGHT OUTER` join, all rows from the right table (specified before the `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` clause) are included, along with matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
   - The primary difference is in the order in which tables are considered, but the result set can be the same by swapping the table order.

2. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):**

   - An ORM is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages.
   - In the context of databases, an ORM maps database tables to classes, and rows to objects. It allows developers to interact with databases using an object-oriented paradigm rather than writing raw SQL queries.
   - ORMs handle the translation between the object-oriented model and the relational model, providing a higher-level, more abstract way to interact with databases.

3. **Differences between AJAX and Server-Side HTTP Requests (e.g., using `requests` library):**

   - **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):**
     - Executes requests asynchronously in the background.
     - Allows for partial page updates without a full page refresh.
     - Typically used in front-end development with JavaScript.
   - **Server-Side Requests (e.g., using `requests` library in Python):**
     - Requests are initiated from the server, not the client browser.
     - Typically used in server-side scripting languages.
     - Results in a full page refresh unless combined with additional techniques (e.g., using AJAX in combination).

4. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**

   - CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It occurs when an attacker can execute actions on behalf of a user without their consent.
   - A CSRF token is a random value generated by the server, embedded in a form, and also stored on the server. The token is validated upon form submission to ensure that the request is legitimate.
   - The purpose of the CSRF token is to mitigate the risk of unauthorized or malicious requests being executed on behalf of a user, especially in scenarios involving state-changing operations (e.g., submitting forms).

5. **Purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`:**
   - In the context of Flask-WTF (WTForms for Flask), `form.hidden_tag()` is a function that generates an HTML `<input>` tag with the type attribute set to "hidden."
   - This hidden input field typically contains the CSRF token, which is used to protect against CSRF attacks.
   - Including the CSRF token in the form allows Flask-WTF to verify the authenticity of the form submission and prevent unauthorized requests.
   - Developers include `form.hidden_tag()` in their form templates to ensure that the CSRF token is included in the HTML form, making the form secure against CSRF attacks.
